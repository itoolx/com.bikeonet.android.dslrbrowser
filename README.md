DSLR browser for Android

With DSLR Browser you can connect through Wi-Fi to a Canon digital SLR camera equipped with a wireless transmitter like the WFT-E5. Switch the transmitter to MediaServ mode then connect with your android phone or tablet to the same wi-fi network the camera is connected to and watch the app automatically discover your camera. Tap it's icon and start browsing, downloading or sharing pictures right off your dslr!

Currently tested with the Canon EOS 7D and the WFT-E5 transmitter - but should work with any Canon DSLR and transmitter capable of UPNP MediaServ mode.
